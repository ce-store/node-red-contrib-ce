To use nodes in Node-RED, place this the node-red-contrib-ce folder in the node_modules of the .node-red folder (/Users/<USER_NAME>/.node-red/node_modules on a mac).

For icons to work need to:
- Clone ce-store repo into the sample-usage directory.
- In ce-store/icons, create a folder named node-red-sample.
- Copy and paste the icons from this folder into the newly created one.
